# Hi, my name is Liliia 💕

**`Python Developer`**

I have 1.5 years of Python experience (7 months of which are commercial) I have experience with the following libraries: Flask, FastAPI, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, pytest, tkinter, and others. I also actively studied C++ and C#. I worked as a mobile game developer and was a team leader in two projects. The first one was software for a car repair service (Python) and the second one was a virtual library (C#).
